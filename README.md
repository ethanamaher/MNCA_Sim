# Simulator for Multi-Neighborhood Cellular Automata

MNCA's are the next step of traditional cellular automata, for example, Conway's Game of Life. By using multiple neighborhoods instead of just one, there is an huge increase in the diversity of states that can emerge.

This is a rewrite of my Java MNCA Simulator in Go. This was more of a test in writing a program for a topic I have good experience in to teach myself Go.

Still needs some performance improvements.
